# Katas
## A repo for keeping track of kata solutions. The equivalent of "scratch paper".
As I grow in my development career, I want to work to prevent some of the fundamentals from escaping my brain. Additionally, doing these Katas is a great way to learn new langs! Especially if I am able to compare a solution from a less-comfortable language to a more comfortable one.

## Comfortable Languages
C#
TypeScript/JS
PowerShell

## Learning Languages
Dart
Rust
